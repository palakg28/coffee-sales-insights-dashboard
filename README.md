# â˜• Coffee Insights Dashboard  
**Turning Raw Sales Data Into Actionable Insights with Excel**  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project showcases a **professional, interactive Excel dashboard** that transforms complex datasets into clear business insights. Using advanced Excel functions and data modeling techniques, I developed a **Coffee Sales Dashboard** that helps track and analyze sales across time, roast types, sizes, and customer segments.  

The dashboard enables quick decision-making by giving managers a single, dynamic view of KPIs such as:  
- **Sales trends over time**  
- **Top performing coffee types**  
- **Sales by country**  
- **Top 5 customers**

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Techniques  
To bring this dashboard to life, I applied a wide range of **Excelâ€™s advanced features**:  
- **XLOOKUP, VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH** â†’ matched and merged sales data across multiple tables.  
- **PivotTables & PivotCharts** â†’ built interactive charts with slicers and timelines.  
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation** â†’ standardized inconsistent data to ensure accuracy.  
- **Conditional Formatting** â†’ highlighted key values and trends for better readability.  
- **Dynamic Filters (Slicers & Timelines)** â†’ made the dashboard fully interactive.

## ðŸš€ Business Impact  
The Coffee Insights Dashboard provides:  
- **Instant visibility into sales performance** â†’ track trends by month, year, or product.  
- **Customer insights** â†’ quickly identify top buyers and loyalty card patterns.  
- **Strategic decision support** â†’ evaluate product performance by roast, size, or geography.  

This project demonstrates how I can **bridge the gap between raw data and business strategy** by using Excel as a powerful analytics tool.
