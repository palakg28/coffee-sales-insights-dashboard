# ☕ Coffee Insights Dashboard  
**Turning Raw Sales Data Into Actionable Insights with Excel**  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project showcases my ability to build a **professional, interactive Excel dashboard** that transforms complex datasets into clear business insights. Using advanced Excel functions and data modeling techniques, I developed a **Coffee Sales Dashboard** that helps track and analyze sales across time, roast types, sizes, and customer segments.  

The dashboard enables quick decision-making by giving managers a single, dynamic view of KPIs such as:  
- **Sales trends over time**  
- **Top performing coffee types**  
- **Sales by country**  
- **Top 5 customers**

## 🔧 Tools & Techniques  
To bring this dashboard to life, I applied a wide range of **Excel’s advanced features**:  
- **XLOOKUP, VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH** → matched and merged sales data across multiple tables.  
- **PivotTables & PivotCharts** → built interactive charts with slicers and timelines.  
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation** → standardized inconsistent data to ensure accuracy.  
- **Conditional Formatting** → highlighted key values and trends for better readability.  
- **Dynamic Filters (Slicers & Timelines)** → made the dashboard fully interactive.

## 🚀 Business Impact  
The Coffee Insights Dashboard provides:  
- **Instant visibility into sales performance** → track trends by month, year, or product.  
- **Customer insights** → quickly identify top buyers and loyalty card patterns.  
- **Strategic decision support** → evaluate product performance by roast, size, or geography.  

This project demonstrates how I can **bridge the gap between raw data and business strategy** by using Excel as a powerful analytics tool.
